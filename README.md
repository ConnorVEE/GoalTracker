# GoalTracker

**GoalTracker** is a personal goal and task tracking web application. It helps you manage your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals â€” all from a centralized dashboard.

This project was created to help me track what I want to do â€” from daily tasks to long-term goals. I wanted a dashboard that greets me each day, shows me what I've got going on for the day, and allows me to track my progress over time in a clear, intuitive way.

The app is built using a **React frontend**, **Django backend**, and an **SQLite database**, with a Python virtual environment used to manage backend dependencies cleanly.

## âœ¨ Features

- Track daily tasks and check them off as completed
- Set and view long-term goals (weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Dashboard overview for today's tasks and goals
- Separation of goal creation and daily execution views
- Intuitive layout for easy goal management
